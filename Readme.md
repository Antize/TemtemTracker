## Requirements

#### Window visibility

For the application to work you must not obstruct any of the interface elements used for detection. These are the Temtem names, minimap and buttons in the bottom row of the game interface that appears during battles.

#### Supported aspect ratios:

- 16:9
- 16:10
- 4:3
- 43:18 (One of 3 aspect ratios marketed as 21:9)
- 64:27 (One of 3 aspect ratios marketed as 21:9)
- 16:3 (still vulnerable to a detection error in omninesia)

#### Minimum supported resolution:

The tracker requires a minimum resolution of 720p or equivalent level of detail at your aspect ratio of choice to be able to detect Temtem reliably.

#### Required software packages:
TemtemTracker V3 requires .NET 4.5.2  and Visual C++ Redistributable 2017 in order to work. 

Windows 10 users most likely already have .NET, as it is part of the Windows 10 Creators Update.

.NET 4.5.2 For Win 8.1 and lower can be found here: [.NET 4.5.2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=42642);

Visual C++ Redistributable 2017 can be downloaded here: 

- [vc_redist.x86.exe (32-bit)](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x86.exe)
- [vc_redist.x64.exe (64-bit)](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) 

OR found here: [Latest supported Visual C++ Downloads](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads)

## Update notes

### V4.3

#### New features

- Added Koish
- Updated the base luma chance to 1/10000

#### Bugfixes/optimization

- Nothing new here, sorry folks

#### Known issues

- TemtemTracker currently does not detect the chaining method and adjust odds for it. A closer look at this will be taken at a later time, but no promises since the chaining method displays numbers anyway.
- Font size scaling from primary monitor causes font to be tiny on secondary monitor with higher resolution/different scaling. This is an issue with the underlying framework and can not yet be addressed at this time. 
- False detections/Missed detections are still possible on water encounters with clouds in the background
- Issue in optical character recognition library causes crash on systems with processors that do not support vector operations. This will be fixed when the fixes are accepted and merged into the library and make it downstream.
