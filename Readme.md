## About

Temtem Tracker is a tracker for encountered Temtem based on Optical Character Recognition. 

The tracker: 
* **DOES NOT** read Temtem memory. 
* **DOES NOT** intercept any Client-Server communication. 
* **DOES NOT** send any requests of its own to any server.
* **DOES NOT** automate any part of gameplay
* **DOES NOT** do anything a player couldn't do themselves using pen and paper
* **WILL NOT** get you banned

## Requirements

#### Window visibility

For the application to work you must not obstruct any of the interface elements used for detection. These are the Temtem names, minimap and buttons in the bottom row of the game interface that appears during battles.

#### Supported aspect ratios:

16:9
16:10
4:3
43:18 (One of 3 aspect ratios marketed as 21:9)
16:3 (still vulnerable to a detection error in omninesia)

#### Minimum supported resolution:

The tracker requires a minimum resolution of 720p or equivalent level of detail to be able to detect Temtem reliably.

#### Required software packages:
TemtemTracker V3 requires .NET 4.5.2  and Visual C++ Redistributable 2017 in order to work. 

Windows 10 users most likely already have .NET, as it is part of the Windows 10 Creators Update.
